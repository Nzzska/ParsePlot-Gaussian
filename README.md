This is small program to parse Gaussian log files for information about excited states, and put them into "nice-to-read" excel report.

Code is written in python, utilising pandas, openpyxl, os and regular expessions. If I'll develope this code any further, it may include more automatic analysis functions,  or parse more data from Gaussian .log files.
